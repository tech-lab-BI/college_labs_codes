# 🧠 OOP Lab Assignments — 5th Sem

Welcome to my **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Lab Assignments** repository!
This repo is a complete collection of all my lab work, built through hands-on coding sessions during my **5th semester**. Each assignment focuses on one or more **core OOP concepts**, applied in real, practical scenarios.

## 📘 About the Repo

This project isn't just a folder of code — it’s a **learning log** that reflects my growth as a programmer.
Every file here represents a concept understood, tested, and implemented in clean, modular code.

**Core OOP Concepts Covered:**

* 🔹 Introduction JAVA , variable , control statement
* 🔹 Classes & Objects (extends , new )
* 🔹 Constructors & Destructors
* 🔹 Inheritance (Single, Multiple, Multilevel, Hierarchical)
* 🔹 Polymorphism (Compile-time & Runtime)
* 🔹 Abstraction (interface , abstract )
* 🔹 Encapsulation (private)
* 🔹 Operator & Method Overloading , Override
* 🔹 Exception Handling
* 🔹 Thread
* 🔹 Package

## 💡 Vision

The goal of this repo is to build **clean, reusable, and scalable OOP code** — not just to pass a lab but to **master object-oriented thinking**.
It’s a step toward writing software that’s efficient, readable, and future-proof.
